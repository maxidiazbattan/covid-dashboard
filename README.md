# Covid-dashboard 
For this dashboard, I have used the plots of one of my Kaggle notebooks, https://www.kaggle.com/code/maxdiazbattan/covid-eda-on-latin-america-dash-dashboard. The data was extracted from the Our World in Data website, then cleaned and filtered with Polars for better efficiency and memory management. Pandas was used just for charting purposes.
The dashboard was made with Dash, a Python framework that allows you to create web apps in pure Python, for more info you can check the documentation here, https://dash.plotly.com/. 
In the following link you can see it, https://covid-dashboard-colj.onrender.com/ (it takes a bit to load the first time because it's dormant at Render Servers, the app works fine, but need to be patient the first time). I hope you like it, and the instructions to use it are below.


# Render Deployment

## Copy this repo to your own personal one
1. On https://github.com/new, create a new repository  
2. In your terminal, in your home directory, clone the repo
3. `cd` into the repository that is created and you should see all the files now.
4. Then, connect this cloned repo to your new personal repo made in Step 1: `git remote set-url origin https://www.github.com/{your-username}/covid-dashboard.git` (be sure to change your username and remove the curly braces)
5. Run `git push origin main` to push the local repo to remote. You should now see this same code in your personal `covid-dashboard` repo.

## Deploy to Render
1. Go to https://render.com/ and create a new account free account. 
2. Once your account was created, click on the "new" button and select web service.
3. Connect your GitHub account and click install.
4. Select the repo you want to deploy, in this case, the repo previously cloned, and click connect.
5. Choose a name for your app, the rest of the options can be the default, with the exception of "Start Command", here we have to change $ gunicorn app:app to $ gunicorn app_name:server. Where app_name it's the name of your app. 
6. If everything it's correct, click on Create Web Service.
7. And that's it, after a couple of minutes, your app it's deployed, congrats!
